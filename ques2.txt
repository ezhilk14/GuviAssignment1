Object:

definition: Object is Intance of class, which is a stand alone entity with properties and types.

-Objects are important data types in javascript.
-Objects too are variables but contain many values.
-Objects are different than primitive datatypes. 
-Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair. 
-These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods.

Every object has some property associated with some value. These values can be accessed using these properties.

Example:

		var myBike = new Object();

		myBike.make= 'Honda';

		myBike.model = 'Peppy';

		myBike.year = 2022;

		myBike.wheels = 2;

After creating myCar object, the value inside the object can be accessed using keys.







Example Output:

1.myBike.year
Output: 2022


2.myBike.wheels
Output:2
